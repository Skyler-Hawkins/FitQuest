Welcome to FitQuest! FitQuest is a fullstack web application that allows users to track height and weight metrics, as well as provides customized workouts based on the needs of the user. 
This was a project for Penn States CMPSC 263: Blockchain and Modern Web Development course. It was my first journey into the huge world of web development. I learned so much from this course and
have been applying my new skills in React and Next to build other web applications such as my own portfolio website.
