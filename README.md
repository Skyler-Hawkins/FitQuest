### Fitquest: A journey into react web development.
Welcome to FitQuest! FitQuest is a fullstack web application that allows users to track height and weight metrics, as well as provides customized workouts based on the needs of the user. 
This was a project for Penn States CMPSC 263: Blockchain and Modern Web Development course. It was my first journey into the huge world of web development, and it gave me a strong basis on Javascript and React. I am not very artistic but I am proud of how this turned out as my first ever website!
